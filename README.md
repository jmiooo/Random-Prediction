Random Prediction Game

Do you ever wonder how we can predict how stocks can go up or down? People have spent decades trying to come up with sophisticated analytical tools to predict stock prices. Why don't we take this hard question one level deeper? 

Instead of trying to predict the value of just stocks, why not try predicting the value of a random data set, that's designed to look similar to a stock? This could be anything from the number of daily shark attacks, to the amount of gold found per day. This has two interesting factors:

- Seeing how well people can predict future data points of random data sets, and if there's an algorithm that would help people invest in random data sets
- Seeing which natural data sets emulate stock prices, and would make people believe it could actually be a stock


Ultimately, this game is for people to have fun playing around with all sorts of data sets (courtesy of Bloomberg's API), and for the user to become the #1 investor of daily beef consumption in the U.S. (in thousands of metric tonnes).
