Random Prediction Game

Do you ever wonder how we can predict how stocks can go up or down? People have spent decades trying to come up with sophisticated analytical tools to predict stock prices. Why don't we take this up another level? 

Instead of trying to predict the value of just stocks, why not try predicting the value of an arbitrary data set, that's designed to look like stock prices? This has two interesting factors:

- Seeing how well people can predict future data points of random data sets, and if there's an algorithm that would help this
- Seeing which natural data sets emulate stock prices, and would make people believe it could actually be a stock


Ultimately, this game is for people to have fun playing around with all sorts of data sets (courtesy of Bloomberg's API), and for the user to become the #1 investor of daily beef consumption around the world (in metric tonnes)
